# Chrome Extensions with Blazor

## Overview

Welcome to the **Chrome Extensions with Blazor** project! This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how to build Chrome extensions using the Blazor framework.

## Features

- **Blazor Integration**: Utilize the Blazor framework to create interactive and dynamic Chrome extensions.
- **C# Development**: Write your extension logic in C# and leverage the .NET ecosystem.
- **Component-based Architecture**: Build reusable components to streamline development and maintenance.
- **MVVM Pattern**: Implement the Model-View-ViewModel pattern for clean separation of concerns.
- **Sample Extension**: Includes a fully functional sample extension to help you get started quickly.
